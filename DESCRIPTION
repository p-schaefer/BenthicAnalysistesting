Description: A package for analysis of Benthic Macroinvertebrate (BMI)
    data using a Reference Condition Approach using the Test Site Analysis
    (Bowman and Somer 2006). This package also allows calculation of
    multiple commonly used metrics used for studying BMI, two methods of
    Nearest-Neighbour matching of test sites with reference sites and
    quantification of error by means of Jacknife Confidence Intervals as
    well as a randomization test for the significance of a test site
    departures from reference conditions.

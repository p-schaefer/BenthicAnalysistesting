Description: A package for analysis of Benthic Macroinvertebrate (BMI) data
    using a Reference Condition Approach using the Test Site Analysis (Bowman and Somer 2006). This package
    also allows calculation of multiple commonly used metrics used for studying BMI,
    two methods of Nearest-Neighbour matching of test sites with reference sites and
    quantification of error by means of Jacknife Confidence Intervals as well as
    a randomization test for the significance of a test site departures from reference conditions.
